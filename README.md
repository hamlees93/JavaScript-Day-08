# Morning Challenge

**Git clone the repo, and complete the following in 'index.html'**

1. Create a landing page that has:
    * a header
    * an image
    * some lorem ipsum in a paragraph
    * a button
    * a colour picker
    * an input box
2. When someone clicks the button a new random image should take the place of the first one (modify the image=0) to be random number
3. When someone chooses a new colour the font colour of the paragraph text should change.
4. When someone types in the header the text should change. If the box is ever empty then it should revert back to the default text
